            <h2>UMD and the surrounding area</h2>
            <p>UMD has many opportunities and benefits that will likely apeal to anyone. If your sports fan than UMD is a good option. We have a D1 Mens and Womens Hockey team, as well as a D2 basketball, Football, Volleyball and more. Another large benefit is how to campus is completely connected. There is no need to go outside in the cold in between classes. Class sizes are also reletively small, professors will get to know you and help more often. Some benefits of the surrounding area include lake Superior, which provides one of the coolest atmospheres in the U.S. You get the benefits of an ocean side school without paying ocean side prices. If you haven't checked it out yet I would highly recommend Canal Park. Canal Park provides some excellent restraunts such as Northern waters Smokehaus, Grandmas, and Loves creamery. It also provides fun stores such as Duluth Pack, and Father Time Antiques. For those who bring their car the North Shore scenic drive is a great time. It includes many scenic points and state parks. Lots of historic spots you can visit on the drive as well. The drive will take you all the way to Grand Maraise, which is a beatiful little town up North. Those are just a few points on why UMD is such a great school with benefits for many people.</p>

            <h2>Why I Choose UMD?</h2>
            <p>I chose UMD for multiple reasons. I am from the Twin Cities and Im a fan of the Gophers but I didn't want to go to school 10 minutes from my house. Duluth is a perfect distance from my house and provides all the same benefits that Twin Cities does. We have D1 sports, and big school benefits such as tutoring programs and intermurals. The price of UMD is also reasonble, especially for those who get reciprocity. I also chose UMD because I enjoy the Duluth area. The lake is cool to look at and its very cool cathcing ships that enter the harbour. Those are a few reasons why I chose to attend UMD.</p>

            <h2>Personal experiences</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite personal experiences would be the intermural basketball. I've been having a great time playing intermural basketball, the competition is competitive and if you win the championship you get a T-shirt which is cool. Another great experience have been my classes. The proffesors are very helpful as long as you take the time to reachout to them. I have also had a fun time exploring the area. Especially the hiking trails located near campus. I would recommend Chester park. Those are a few personal experiences i've had and enjoyed while being at Duluth.</p>
