                    <ul>
                        <li>I participated in a lot of sports while I was in highschool. The main sports I played were basketball, track and field, and cross country.</li>
                        <li>My biggest hobby is probably cars and race cars specifically.</li>
                        <li>Im a fan of art. I enjoy trying to make art occasionally, but I mainly enjoy going to art museums and things of that sort.</li>
                        <li>Another interest of mine is audio. I appreciate a quality audio system and recording gear.</li>

                <h2>Why I Love These Hobbies</h2>
                <div class="text-content">
                    <!-- Add your explanations here -->
                    <p><li>These sports are important to me becuase I find it fun to compete and have competition. Ive also made many friends while particpating in these activities.</li>
                       <li>Cars have been a large interest of mine since I was a kid. I love the sound they make and the speed some cars have. I am very interested in cornering speed caused by aerodynamics and mechanical grip. Thats partly why I love race cars so much, the loud sounds race cars make are also very cool. They overall community around cars is one of the best community as well.</li>
                        <li>Art is more of a recent interest for me. Ive always been around and introduced to art but really got into it after taking a painting class. I thought it was very fun to create the paintings in that class. I also love the sophisticated cultrue centered around the art scene.</li>
                        <li>Lastly audio. I wouldn't necessarily call myself an audiophile however I do appreciate a proper system. Recently I installed new speakers into my car including a very large subwoofer, and I think the whole set up is extremely fun. I also love proper recording gear. I go to a lot of car racing events and always want to capture the audio in the best way possible. I have been exploring somthing called 3d audio that records audio as your ear would hear it. Its very cool.</li>
